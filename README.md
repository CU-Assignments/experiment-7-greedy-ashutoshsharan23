# Exp-6-Dynamic Programming


## ** Dynamic Programming (DP)**
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results for future reference.

## ** Key Concepts**
### **1. Optimal Substructure**
A problem exhibits **optimal substructure** if its solution can be constructed from the solutions of its subproblems.  
Example: The shortest path in a graph can be broken into smaller shortest path subproblems.

### **2. Overlapping Subproblems**
A problem has **overlapping subproblems** when it solves the same subproblems multiple times.  
Example: Fibonacci sequence, where `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`, repeatedly calculates the same Fibonacci numbers.

### **3. Memoization (Top-Down Approach)**
- Uses **recursion** with a **cache (array or hashmap)** to store previously computed results.
- Avoids redundant calculations.

### **4. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)**
- Uses **iteration** and builds up solutions from smaller subproblems.
- Typically more space-efficient.
